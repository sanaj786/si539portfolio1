            <p>This project was developed as a part of the 2020 CHI Game Design Competition. For this, my team and I created a 2 minutes game trailer, a 2 minutes gameplay demo  and a research paper. We were given two prompts out of which we choose the prompt "to expand the boundaries of the gameplay and explore the role of gamification in a non-game setting such as medical, education, sustainability, etc."

                We then choose 'Environment' as the main topic of our game and carried out user research to narrow down the scope.
