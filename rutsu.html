            <p>Rūtsu is an interactive and engaging application, aimed to help young and second generation Japanese immigrants to stay in touch and learn more about their culture and heritage through gamification. 

                There are over 3.8 million Japanese immigrants in different parts of the world, approximately 1.5 million of them are in America alone. I have chosen this set of users for my project as, after several personal experiences and research, I have come to realize that the younger generation of Japanese immigrants do not know about their rich traditions and culture and second generation immigrants feel like they are losing touch with their roots. This often causes their parents to worry and even creates a communication barrier with elder relatives like grandparents. Further, after talking to several young Japanese immigrants, I noticed that they DO want to learn about their culture, but just cannot find a medium that they can stick with for long without getting bored.
