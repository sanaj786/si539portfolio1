            <p>The Department of English Language and Literature is one of the largest departments within the School of Literature, Science and the Arts. They offer over 500 courses to over 8000 students in a given year. Scheduling courses is one of the most crucial tasks that the staff has to do multiple times in a year. Currently, the department has a course scheduling workflow that is filled with redundancies and inefficiencies. Our team worked with the Department of English and looked for recommendations to simplify the course schedule workflow and reduce some of the redundancies. The report details our findings on the course scheduling workflow and its underlying issues at the Department of English at the University of Michigan.  Based on our research, contextual interviews and affinity wall, we suggest some recommendations.
