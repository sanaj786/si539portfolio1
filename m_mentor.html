            <p>I was given this design problem as part of the Google 2020 Design Challenge for User Experience Design Internship. I chose the second prompt that dealt with creating an experience that allows mentors and mentees to discover each other. As an international student at University of Michigan, I have personally experienced the need of mentor several times. I would have appreciated a way for me to discover 

                experienced students who could help me with the transition. This is why I chose this prompt.
                
                I tried to keep the functionality of the system fairly simple and straightforward since the main objective of the challenge is to give a platform to mentors and mentees that makes the process of finding a mentor or a mentee easy and efficient without any hassle.
                
                Lastly, I based the system on University of Michigan, since that would help me be more empathetic to the users. Though the system can be easily implemented for any school.
